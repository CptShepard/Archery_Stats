# Archery_Stats
Score/Distance Tracker


This code block is designed to outline {user} archery performance at [input] distance(s) via matplotlib DV.

PSA: Requesting assistance improving functionality to track linear performance at each distance based on subsequent sessions. 'Date' variable is current 'x-axis' variable; Preferred update will have 'session #' as 'x-axis' variable corresponding to distance practiced for the session. Each distance practiced should be uniquedly identified on the DV.
