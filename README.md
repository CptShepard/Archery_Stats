Update: 04/19/23

Code block has been edited to address previous patch request. Improvments include: Score (y-axis) tallied to maximum score per session. User can plot subsequent training sessions at various distances for 30-day tracking record at each.

Next Update: Suggestions welcome on how to automate session # per distance to maintain data tracking integrity by minimizing user input error. Current error pending that prevents proper syncronization of csv file data points to visualization table.

PSA: Requesting assistance improving functionality to track linear performance at each distance based on subsequent sessions. 'Date' variable is current 'x-axis' variable; Preferred update will have 'session #' as 'x-axis' variable corresponding to distance practiced for the session. Each distance practiced should be uniquedly identified on the DV.
